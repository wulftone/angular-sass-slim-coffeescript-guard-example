angular-sass-slim-coffeescript-guard-example
============================================

A simple example on how to start a project using AngularJS, SASS, CoffeeScript, Slim, and Guard to auto-compile it all for you.

As a bonus, I included the "Foundation 4" css framework to play with.

1. Clone/fork/download/whatever the project
2. Run `bundle install`
3. Run `guard`
4. Open `public/index.html` in your favorite browser and see if it works
5. Edit to your heart's content!
